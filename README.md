## Projects

### [Data Modeling](https://github.com/GeneralSyntaxAnomaly/AWS-Cloud-Engineer-Nano-Degree/tree/main/1_Data_Modeling/project)

In this project,

- Apply concepts learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python.
- Model the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries effectively.

### [Cloud Data Warehouses](https://github.com/GeneralSyntaxAnomaly/AWS-Cloud-Engineer-Nano-Degree/tree/main/2_Cloud_Data_Warehouses/project)

In this project,

- Apply concepts of data warehousing and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift.
- Load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements to create analytics tables from these staging tables.

### [Spark and Data Lakes](https://github.com/GeneralSyntaxAnomaly/AWS-Cloud-Engineer-Nano-Degree/tree/main/3_Spark_and_Data_Lakes/project)

In this project,

- Utilize Spark and AWS Glue to process data from multiple sources, categorize the data, and curate it for future querying and multiple purposes.
- Build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.

### [Automate Data Pipelines](https://github.com/GeneralSyntaxAnomaly/AWS-Cloud-Engineer-Nano-Degree/tree/main/4_Automate_Data_Pipelines/project)

In this project,

- Use Airflow to create high-grade data pipelines that are dynamic, built from reusable tasks, monitored, and allow for easy backfills.
- Create custom operators to perform tasks such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the data as the final step.
